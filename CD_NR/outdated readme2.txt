I have yet to implement advanced AI such as ranged, bosses, and "story." Also, no objects are mobile yet. Lastly,
the motion controls have been limited to walking, attacking, and jumping. The art isn't final either.

Controls:
	A and D for walking
	Mouse to aim
	Left Mouse Button to shoot
	Space to jump
